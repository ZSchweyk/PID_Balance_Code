This is the code I wrote to program a self-balancing seesaw with a moving ping pong ball on it! It consists of a Lidar sensor and servo motor, which I read and write to respectively in this program. It's also my first project involving closed loop control (PID loops), and I learned a lot about it.
I wrote thorough, line by line comments if you'd like to fully understand everything behind the calculations.
